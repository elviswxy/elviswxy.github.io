- title: Research Areas
  type: list
  contents:
  - My research focuses on developing algorithms for machine learning and applying my methods in order to study how machines can mimic humans in congitive tasks, especially those related to Language.
  - I am also interested in creating AI agents that can understand language and reason, therefore I have also worked on natural language processing with a focus on language generation.
  - Currently I'm focusing my efforts at Google Deepmind in improving the generation capabilities and studying alignment of large language models, including RLHF and preference optimization during post-training.
