#     - 'Dr. Wu has led projects aimed at improving how search engines and recommendation systems rank results. In one project, he developed a product search ranking model using multi-task deep learning (combining language understanding and ranking in one framework). This approach improved the relevance of top results and was successfully tested on a major retailer’s search platform. Another project introduced a meta-learning to rank algorithm that helps search systems quickly adapt to sparse or new data (useful when user feedback is limited). These efforts not only enhanced performance metrics (like click-through rate and ranking fairness) but also resulted in published research validating the techniques.'

He has investigated whether Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) – feeding external documents into an AI model to help it answer questions – might introduce unfair bias into the model’s responses. Additionally, he conducted an empirical study on how well large language models serve as rankers, i.e. if they can rank search results without favoring or disadvantaging content related to certain demographic groups. These projects provide insights into the biases of state-of-the-art AI and guide the development of fairer algorithms. Findings from this research were presented in recent NLP conferences, helping raise awareness of AI fairness in the research community.'
